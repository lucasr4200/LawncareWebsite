# LawnCare by Lucas - Lawn Care Management System

## Overview
LawnCare by Lucas is a lawn care management system designed for both internal business operations and customer interactions. It includes an internal dashboard for managing customers, scheduling services, financial tracking, and route optimization. Additionally, it provides a customer facing site where clients can book lawn care appointments.
Note: At the moment this is not meant to be a funcitonal business website, it is made for the purposes of enahcning my knowledge of REACT and web design and integrating it with my background in AI /ML projects (see travelling salesman problem below).

## Features
### Internal Dashboard
- View and manage customer information.
- Access financial reports (income and expenses).
- Plan optimal routes using a **Traveling Salesman Algorithm** to minimize driving distance.
- Interactive **Today's Planner** with a map and a list of scheduled destinations.
- Add **What-if Customers** dynamically to simulate route changes.

### Customer-Facing Site
- Book lawn care services directly through an online form.
- View company details and service pricing.
- Store booking data locally for retrieval in the internal dashboard.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) with TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Maps & Geolocation**: Leaflet.js & OpenStreetMap
- **Local Data Storage**: `localStorage` for temporary booking persistence

## Installation

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
